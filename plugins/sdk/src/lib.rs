//! Write a NADI plugin as a WebAssembly module.
//!
//! The island calls the module with an [`Event`] (the audio, the programs that are open, a file that changed, the
//! calendar, what is playing, how busy the PC is, a button that was pressed, or a tick) and the module answers with a
//! [`Reply`]: what the island is to do. A card in the hub, a pill when something is going on, rings, banners, events for
//! the calendar. The module keeps what it needs between calls (a `thread_local!` is fine), has no network and no clock
//! but `event.now`, and is cut off when a call takes longer than its budget (4 ms unless the manifest asks for less). What
//! it may see is what its manifest lists.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use nadi_plugin::*;
//! fn handle(ev: &Event) -> Reply {
//!     Reply::card(Card::new().icon("wave").title("Hello").sub(format!("{} windows", ev.windows.len())))
//! }
//! plugin!(handle);
//! ```
