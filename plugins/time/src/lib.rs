//! Time: every so often the island drops down as a small pill that says what time it is. It lines up with the clock
//! (every 30 minutes means :00 and :30), so it never needs to count: it asks the island to wake it at the next minute,
//! and says the time when the minute is one of the marks. It sees nothing but the time.
//!
//! This plugin ships with NADI, and is written as any plugin can be: the island treats it as one you might have dropped
//! in a folder. Pressing "Show it now" in its settings sends it the `preview` action; what it says in answer to a button
//! is always shown.
